# ðŸ“„ Synthetic Data Generator Documentation

## Overview

This module creates synthetic insurance data to simulate real-world operations in a SACCO/insurance context.
The dataset includes agents,agents performance, premiums, claims, and commission records across multiple customers and policies.
The goal is to provide a realistic but privacy-safe dataset for testing databases, dashboards, and automation pipelines.

### Why Synthetic Data?

- **Privacy**: No real customer data is exposed.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to scale up rows and adjust distributions.
- **Reproducibility**: Anyone running this project can generate consistent datasets.
- **Complexity**: Data mimics common insurance patterns (commission payments, claims delays, commission structures, claims trends).
 
## Data Model
The generator creates multiple related tables:

**Customers Table**
Fields: ClientID,Name,DOB,Age,Gender,Location,JoinDate,Tier,LifetimeValue,RiskProfile

**Policies Table**
Fields: PolicyID,ClientID,AgentID,PolicyType,StartDate,EndDate,PremiumAmount,Status,Channel,PaymentStatus,RiskScore,OriginalPolicyID,RenewalNumber,BusinessType,TransactionType,CoverageType,VehicleAge,UsageType



Claims Table

Fields: claim_id, policy_id, claim_date, claim_amount, status (approved, rejected, pending).

Commissions Table

Fields: commission_id, agent_id, policy_id, date, commission_amount.

Features of the Generator

Random but controlled distributions:

Age range 18â€“70 with realistic skew.

Region assignment with weighted probabilities.

Policy types distributed across Life, Motor, Medical, etc.

Date realism:

Payments and claims spread over months/years.

Join dates backdated realistically.

Business logic:

Premiums linked to policies.

Claims linked to active policies.

Commissions tied to premium collections.

Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, faker, random, datetime).

How to Run

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the generator script:

python generate_synthetic_data.py


Output:

CSV files saved in /data/raw/.

Example:

data/raw/customers.csv
data/raw/policies.csv
data/raw/premiums.csv
data/raw/claims.csv
data/raw/commissions.csv

Sample Output (customers.csv)
customer_id	name	age	gender	join_date	region
C001	John Mwangi	34	Male	2021-06-15	Nairobi
C002	Grace Atieno	47	Female	2019-09-12	Kisumu
Next Steps

Scale data volume (e.g., 10k+ rows).

Add fraud-like anomalies for testing AI monitoring.

Parameterize script (--n_customers, --start_date) for flexible runs.
