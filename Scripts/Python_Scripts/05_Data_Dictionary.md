## Business KPI Dictionary 

### Premium (KES)
Definition: The total value of all insurance policies sold, measured in Kenyan Shillings.
Why it matters: This is the company’s main source of revenue — higher premiums mean more business coming in.
Formula: Add up the PremiumAmount from all active policies.

### Renewals
Definition: The number of existing policies that are extended after their expiry date.
Why it matters: Renewals show customer loyalty. A high number means clients are happy and stick around.
Formula: Count of policies where TransactionType = "Renewal".

### Retention Rate
Definition: The percentage of clients who keep their policies (renew) instead of leaving or letting them lapse.
Why it matters: Retaining a client is usually cheaper than finding a new one. High retention means stability.
Formula: (Renewed Policies ÷ Total Renewable Policies) × 100.

### Active Customers
Definition: Clients who currently hold an active policy.
Why it matters: Shows how many paying customers the company has at this moment.
Formula: Count of distinct ClientID with at least one Status = "Active" policy.

### Lapse Rate
Definition: The percentage of policies that stop because the customer did not renew.
Why it matters: A high lapse rate means lost revenue and poor client satisfaction.
Formula: (Lapsed Policies ÷ Total Policies) × 100.

### Open Claims
Definition: Claims that have been filed but are not yet resolved (still pending or under investigation).
Why it matters: Open claims represent money that might need to be paid soon.
Formula: Count of claims where ClaimStatus is “Pending” or “Under Investigation.”

### Loss Ratio
Definition: Compares how much the company pays out in claims to how much it earns in premiums.
Why it matters: If this ratio is above 100%, the company is paying more than it’s earning — a big red flag for profitability.
Formula: (Approved Claim Amount ÷ Premiums Collected) × 100.

### Average Policy Sold
Definition: The average amount of premium earned from each policy sold.
Why it matters: Helps compare product sizes — are agents selling small or large policies?
Formula: (Total Premium ÷ Number of Policies).

### Risky Clients
Definition: Customers who are likely to file claims, default on payments, or let their policy lapse — based on risk scoring.
Why it matters: Too many risky clients increase costs and reduce profit.
Formula: Clients where RiskProfile = "High".

### High-Risk Delinquent Clients
Definition: The riskiest group — clients flagged as high risk who are also late or defaulting on payments.
Why it matters: These clients are the most likely to cost the company money. They need special attention or restrictions.
Formula: Clients with RiskProfile = "High" AND PaymentStatus IN ("Late","Default").

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
Definition: The total amount of money a customer brings in over the entire time they stay with the company.
Why it matters: Shows how valuable a single client is. Companies use LTV to decide how much to spend on acquiring new customers.
Formula: Duration with company × Total premiums paid.

### Money at Risk
Definition: The total premium exposure from high-risk clients. Can be adjusted by their risk score (weighting).
Why it matters: This shows the “worst-case scenario” if risky customers make claims or default.
Formula: Sum of PremiumAmount for High Risk active policies. Weighted version = Premium × RiskScore.
