# 🚀 Automated BI & Monitoring System for Insurance Analytics  

## Imara Insurance Analytics – Case Study

This project simulates an end-to-end analytics system for a fictional insurance company called Imara. The aim is to demonstrate how data pipelines, machine learning, and interactive dashboards can power real-time decision-making in insurance operations.

By generating realistic synthetic data, storing it in a structured PostgreSQL database, and layering on Power BI dashboards, Python ETL, and automated anomaly alerts, the system replicates both the challenges and solutions that insurers face daily. The outcome is a production-style analytics and monitoring ecosystem that executives could use to gain instant clarity on revenue, risk, and performance while cutting reporting time from days to minutes.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
Synthetic Data → PostgreSQL Database → Python ETL Scripts → Power BI Dashboards → Monitoring & Email Alerts

## 🔑 Project Phases

### Synthetic Data Generation
- Created realistic datasets for customers, agents, policies, sales, claims, and commissions.
- Simulated daily transactions, renewals, and claims processing.
- Introduced variability & anomalies (e.g., missing data, duplicates, outliers) to mimic real-world noise.

[*Click here for a deep dive into synthetic data generation docs*](Documentantion/01_Synthetic_Data_Generator_Documentation.md)

### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
- Designed a normalized schema for insurance operations.
- Enforced relationships (clients → policies → claims → sales).
- Loaded synthetic datasets into PostgreSQL using Python scripts.

### Data Cleaning & Processing (ETL)
- SQL scripts for cleaning and validation.
- Removed duplicates, fixed categorical typos, handled nulls.
- Stored curated data into reporting tables.

[*Click here for detailed documented explanations for the database set-up and data cleaning*](Documentantion/02_SQL_Schema_Data_Cleaning.md)

### Interactive Dashboards (Power BI)
- Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.
- Built executive dashboards with key KPIs:
    - Premium collections
    - Claims analysis
    - Commission payouts
    - Renewal trends
- Added slicers and drill-downs for interactivity.
- Included a “How to Use” guide for non-technical users.

[*Click here for the dashboard design docs*](Documentantion/03_Dashboard_design.md)

### Monitoring & Alerting System
- Python monitoring script tracks:
- Sudden drops in premiums
- Abnormal spikes in commissions (will also track abnormal spikes in claims in the future.)
- Sends automated email alerts with AI-generated summaries.
- Scheduled via batch script for continuous monitoring.

[*click here for the monitoring & alert system docs*](Documentantion/04_Monitor_&_Alert_System.md)

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, psycopg2, smtplib, faker, numpy)
- PostgreSQL (relational database)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards & KPI monitoring)
- Batch scripting (task scheduling)
- OpenAI API (AI-generated anomaly summaries)

📊 Key Features
✅ End-to-end pipeline: from raw data → insights → action
✅ Automated cleaning, validation, and storage in PostgreSQL
✅ Executive dashboards with KPI tracking & drill-downs
✅ Real-time monitoring and email alerting
✅ Scalable to cloud deployment & ML forecasting
